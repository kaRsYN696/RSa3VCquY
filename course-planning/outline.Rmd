- [Greg Wilson](http://third-bit.com)

## Day 1

1.  Getting Started/Two Ways to Teach `r day_1(10)` - **Greg**
    -   `./keynotes/01-Getting-Started.key`
    -   Poll participants on how they learn better.
    -   Then point out that this doesn't align with how people normally teach: lecture to "transfer" information.
    -   Tell participants there's lots of research (much of which people don't know/act on)

1.  Novice/Competent Practitioner/Expert `r day_1(45)` - **Greg**
    -   `./keynotes/02-Mental-Models.key`
    -   Mental models
        -   Emphasize linkages: we rarely forget completely, but we lose the ability to retrieve
    -   Mental models don't have to be right to be useful (ball-and-spring models in chemistry)
    -   How the graph model of human cognition expains the difference between competent and experts
        -   Experts have more connections
    -   Concept maps as visual representations of mental models
    -   Using concept maps:
        -   To design lesson
        -   To convey information to learners
        -   For insight into their learning
    -   **Exercise**: draw and compare concept maps for RStudio's professional products

1.  The Cognitive Craft `r day_1(45)` - **Garrett**
    -   `./keynote/40-cognitive-craft.key`
    -   Introduce cognitive architecture diagram
    -   Introduce 7Â±2
    -   Lesson "scenes" should fit into working memory
        -   Use exercises/discussion/elaborative examples to keep new material there long enough to be transcribed
    -   Poll - What's better at conveying a mental model: Explanations or Exercises?
    -   Cognitive load theory
        -   Intrinsic
        -   Extraneous
        -   Germane
        -   Tetris analogy
    -   Describe how to apply this to explain something effectively
        -   Begin with a simple mental model, preferably an analogy that leverages what they already know. Visualizations are an inherent analogy.
        -   Build upon that, adding facts in a logical order
        -   Connect to what they already know
        -   Point out the limits of your mental model/analogy if necessary
    -   **Exercise**: Write an explanation for why someone would use your favorite RStudio product, you will teach this later.
    -   **Exercise**: What will your explanation not do?
    
1. Coffee `r day_1(15)`

1. Two Ways to Teach/Formative Assessment `r day_1(35)` - **Greg**
    -   Active vs. passive learners
        -   Teaching is "load into short-term memory and keep it there long enough to be transferred"
    -   Explain what active learning is: creates a real-time feedback loop in class
    -   Importance of feedback loop while teaching (for instructor as well as learners)
    -   Comparison with movie/play (add comedy improv)
    -   MCQ example: 37 + 15 = a) 52 b) 42 c) 412 d) 43
    -   Dual purposes of formative assessments (feedback loop + reinforcement)
    -   **Exercise**: create question to figure out what someone on a support call doesn't understand (diagnose misconceptions)

1.  Teaching as Performance I `r day_1(30)` - **Greg**
    -   `./keynote/30-teaching-as-performance-1.key`
    -   Critique the Nederbragt videos
        -   [Bad](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE)
        -   [Good](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY)
    -   **Exercise**: teach in pairs: live coding / webinar style (no recording)

1.  **Homework**: Create a few slides that you could use to re-teach your content tomorrow, along with the script you will try to stick to.

## Day 2

1. Review `r day_2(20)` - **Garrett**
    -   Look at the [Divio Model](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/)
        -   Tutorial
        -   How-To
        -   Explanation
        -   Reference
    -   Do these categories make sense in light of novice-competent-expert?
    -   Do they make sense in terms of unconscious incompetence - to - unconscious incompetence?
    -   Bloom's Taxonomy (very briefly, with caveats)
        -   Google isn't enough if you don't know what to search for or how to recognize a useful answer when you find one
        -   Grolemund added "awareness" to the bottom of the Bloom hierarchy since it's the most realistic goal for a workshop like this

1.  Motivation `r day_2(30)` - **Greg**
    -   `./keynote/70-motivation.key`
    -   If the student needs to expend the generative load, your job is to motivate them to do it
    -   Three big motivators: self-efficacy, utility, community
    -   Three big demotivators: unpredictability, unfairness, indifference
    -   Zone of Proximal Development
    -   **Exercise**: what demotivates people in programming demos and how do we prevent/fix it?
    -   **Question**: can R syntax itself be demotivating?
        -   [Study](http://neverworkintheory.org/2014/01/29/stefik-siebert-syntax.html) where Perl syntax was as hard to use as random symbols
    
1.  Multimedia Learning `r day_2(45)` - **Garrett**
    -   `./keynote/80-multimedia-learning.key`
    -   Dual coding theory
        -   Revisit cognitive architecture diagram: signals are competing for channels
    -   Critique some bad slides
    -   **Exercise**: Take the slides that you made; make them more visual, altering your script if necessary.
    -   **Exercise**: Do it again pushing it even farther.
    
1.  Coffee `r day_2(15)`

1.  Teaching as Performance II `r day_2(30)` - **Greg**
    -   `./keynote/60-teaching-as-performance-2.key`
    -   Use the previous day's rubric
    -   Two groups, everyone talks over the graphic they made overnight

1.  Group Exercise `r day_2(15)` - **Garrett**
    -   What are the pros and cons of R Markdown for documentation, books, or slides from a cognitive point of view?
